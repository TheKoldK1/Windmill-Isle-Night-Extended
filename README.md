# Windmill Isle Night Extended
Update server for my mod that combines Windmill Isle Night Act 1 with its DLC levels


# Description of the mod
Windmill Isle's DLC night time stages would seem to work well if their stage layouts were combined to add more length to the stage and to overhaul the original stage as they both start around the end of Act 1, and I have found a way to make that idea a reality.

This mod expands on Windmill Isle Night Act 1 by combining its stage layout with its two DLC stage layouts. After playing through the original stage layout and reaching the end, you will be transitioned to the DLC layouts. 

This was done through a lot of XML editing; when comparing these to the levels on their own, there are only some very small differences in terms of camera behaviour that I noticed, which can definitely be overlooked. So for that to be the only difference and for my first night stage mod, I feel like I have done well with this. That being said, if anyone happens to run into any issues that I don't know about, please do let me know.

Layout Confugration:

- Extend to 1-2: This option allows you to play through Act 1 and then transition over to Act 1-2
- Extend to 1-3: This option allows you to play through Act 1 and then transition over to Act 1-3
- Three In One: This option allows you to play though the three stage layouts at once, starting with Act 1, going over to Act 1-3 and then finishing in Act 1-2.

In addition, if you have the Apotos Adventure Pack DLC installed, this mod will replace Act 1-3 with a combination of both Act 1-3 and Act 1-2 stage layouts.

Inspiration to do this mod was taken from the Dragon Road & Arid Sands - Complete Edition mods by RFunk195, Jungle Joyride Night Restoration by TheStorm and Savannah Citadel Night Act 1 & 4 United by DanyloGX, who is also working on a restoration of Skyscraper Scamper Night, which for its progress can be found here.

Known Issues:

When transitioning over to the 1-2 portion of the stage, the sound effect of the saws that appear in the small alley outside the battle arena will randomly start to play faintly, even if they haven't been activated through the crank ~~and they are so ridiculously loud when eventually switched on~~. From testing it seems to happen if the game is paused before entering that portion, however this happens if you pause in the original stage so I am not sure if there ***is*** a fix for it.
