# Windmill Isle Night Extended
Update server for my mod that combines Windmill Isle Night Act 1 with its DLC levels


# Description of the mod
Windmill Isle's DLC night time stages would seem to work well if their stage layouts were combined to add more length to the stage as they both start around the end of Act 1, and I have found a way to make that idea a reality.

This mod expands on Windmill Isle Night Act 1 by combining the stage with its two DLC level layouts. After playing through the original stage and reaching the end, you will be transitioned to the stage designs of Act 1-2 and Act 1-3 - kind of like how Windmill Isle Day Act 1-2 is designed, but opposite. 

When comparing this mod to the levels on their own, there were only some very, very small differences in terms of camera behaviour that I noticed within the battle arena. For that to be the only contrast and for my first night stage mod, I feel like I have done well with this. That being said, if anyone happens to run into any issues that I don't know about, please do let me know.

## Layout Confugration

- **Extend to 1-2**: This option allows you to play through Act 1 and then transition over to Act 1-2
- **Extend to 1-3**: This option allows you to play through Act 1 and then transition over to Act 1-3
- **Three In One**: This option allows you to play though the three stage layouts at once, starting with Act 1, going over to Act 1-3 and then finishing in Act 1-2.

In addition, if you have the Apotos Adventure Pack DLC installed, Act 1-3 will be replaced with a combination of both Act 1-3 and Act 1-2 stage layouts.

Inspiration to do this mod was taken from the Dragon Road & Arid Sands - Complete Edition mods by RFunk195, Jungle Joyride Night Restoration by TheStorm and Savannah Citadel Night Act 1 & 4 United by DanyloGX, who is also working on a restoration of Skyscraper Scamper Night.

## Known Issues:

When transitioning over to the 1-2 stage layout, the sound effect of the saws that appear in the small alley outside the battle arena will randomly start to play faintly, even if they haven't been activated through the crank ~~and they are so ridiculously loud when eventually switched on~~. It seems to happen if the game is paused before entering the 1-2 segement, however this also happens if you pause in the original stage so I am not sure if there ***is*** a fix for it.
